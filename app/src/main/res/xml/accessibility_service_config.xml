    SECURITY: This Accessibility Service is RESTRICTED TO TIKTOK ONLY.

    The android:packageNames attribute below is a SYSTEM-LEVEL restriction.
    Android OS will ONLY deliver events from these packages to this service.

    This means:
    - Service CANNOT access banking apps, messaging apps, or ANY other app
    - Service CANNOT read passwords or sensitive data from other apps
    - Service CANNOT take screenshots of other apps
    - Service CANNOT perform gestures in other apps

    This restriction is enforced by Android OS, not by our code.
    Even if our code had bugs, Android would block access to other apps.

    Packages allowed (all are TikTok variants):
    - com.zhiliaoapp.musically = TikTok (main international)
    - com.ss.android.ugc.trill = TikTok Lite

    See SECURITY.md for full security documentation.
